<!-- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. -->
    <!-- Need to make buttons with pics  -->

<!-- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. -->
    <!-- Need box area to show random number generated -->


<!-- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. -->
    <!-- JS- generate 4 random numbers that will be hidden from view.  Attribute these numbers to the crystals. -->

<!-- Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. -->
    <!-- Make sure numbers attributed to crytals are hidden to the user. -->

<!-- When they do click one, update the player's score counter. -->
    <!-- Need Function to update the player's score counter as the crystals are pressed. -->

<!-- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. -->
<!-- The player loses if their score goes above the random number. -->
    <!-- If the player matches the displayed score then the player wins that game. -->
    <!-- If the player goes over the displayed score then the player loses that game. -->

<!-- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. -->
    <!-- Make reset Function -->

<!-- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. -->

<!-- The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game. -->

<!-- Option 1 Game design notes -->


<!-- The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120. -->


<!-- Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12. -->
